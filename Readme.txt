Initial Commit

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a game company that wants to server up their Win, Lose or Draw game onto multiple (see all) platoforms.  

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Working through all of the various operating system platforms was perhaps the most involved portion of the documentation.  Ensuring all avenues were available to the client without necessarily knowing the systems in depth. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the needs of the client in regards to where they wanted to release the software helped to narrow down the scope of the project.  It also helped to determine programming language and operating system platform.  

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The initial UML diagram and design constraints.  Further elaborating on constraints and ensuring that my model was correct.  


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By interpreting where the user planned to provide the software to their clients allowed for better planning into memory mmanagement, security, and operating platform decisions.  

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would dig further into the initial request from the client to ensure that all needs were being met by the initial design.  This will allow for a better clean slate approach versus having to adjust when the user decided to provide the information.
